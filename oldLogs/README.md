This directory used to contain the logs of previous runs of the AMS-DEMO optimization algorithm that can be used for model building. There are two types of files that could be used for building the models:
```
individuals*.log
evaluations*.log
```

Both have information about evaluated solutions stored, however, `evaluations*.log` has better precision.

The files here were deleted, because the simulator is being changed. Use the latest version of simulator in order to generate logs. Contact the maintainers of this repository if you need to obtain up-to date data.
